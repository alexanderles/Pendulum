## Introduction

Pendulum is a platform that allows experts from various industries to monetize their knowledge by selling the right to ask them questions within their areas of expertise. We aim to connect experts and their audiences, providing direct access to industry professionals at market prices. Our platform leverages Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) called "Pendulums" to grant the exclusive right to ask questions in a Q&A format.

With Pendulum, experts can issue a unique Pendulum NFT for each topic they specialize in. Only one Pendulum is issued per expert per topic, ensuring exclusivity and enhancing the value of each Pendulum. The owner of a Pendulum can continue asking questions in the Q&A until the Pendulum is purchased by someone else or it's expired or it runs out of energy.

To promote the exchange of Pendulums, we have implemented a Harberger Tax system. Owners of Pendulums will be taxed based on their self-determined ask price, encouraging a dynamic market for the tokens.
